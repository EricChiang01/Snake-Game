# Snake Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic Snake Game using the Pygame library in Python. The game involves controlling a snake and guiding it to eat food while avoiding collisions with the boundaries of the game window or the snake's own body.

## How to Run
1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can download Python from the [official website:](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. Install the Pygame library by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt: ```pip install pygame```
3. Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where the file is saved, and run the following command: ```python snake_game.py```

## How to Play
- Control the snake's direction using the arrow keys on your keyboard. The snake can move up, down, left, or right.
- The objective is to eat the red food that randomly appears on the screen.
- Each time the snake eats food, its length increases, and your score goes up.
- The game ends if the snake collides with the boundaries of the game window or its own body.
- After the game ends, you can close the game window to exit the program.

## Game Controls
- Arrow Up: Move the snake up
- Arrow Down: Move the snake down
- Arrow Left: Move the snake left
- Arrow Right: Move the snake right
